# OOP JP Project
Class project for my Object Oriented Programming course

# About
This program implements classes, interfaces, and enums in order to create a flexible
structure for any production line. The Java collection ArrayList is used to contain objects
that extend the abstract class, Product. The list is then sorted and its object's information
is printed to the console.
